# Hi :wave:

In this repository you will find two directories where in each of them you will find a different challenge:

- kubernetes: the challenge is to fix some YAML manifests from kubernetes
- terraform: a challenge to refactor terraform code into a module that can be reused in different environments.

In each directory are the necessary resources and a markdown describing the challenge. The only pre-requisite is a GitHub.com account. Although not required, other utilities such as terraform cli and kubectl may be of help.

We estimate that it should not take more than two hours to complete the two challenges included. 

## Instructions

1. Create a new **private** repository on GitHub.com.
2. Make a first commit to the main branch of your choice by uploading the content.
3. Create one Pull Request for each challenge with your proposed solution including every comment you think appropriate.
4. Give read access to **TumeloTechTask** account to the private repository (Settings > Access > Collaborators)
5. Let us know by email that you have finished the test and send us the URL of the repository

Thank you for investing your time in these challenges!

_If you have any doubt or issue don't hesitate to contact us!_
