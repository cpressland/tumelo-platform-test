Two challenges are included in the zip: one related to kubernetes and another related to terraform. You must create a private repository on GitHub to upload all the contents of the zip, so first you will have to unzip it and then make a first commit. 

Follow the next steps:

1. Unzip the attached zip file
2. Create a private GitHub repository
3. Push first commit with the all the files of the zip extracted in the first step
4. Read the attached README.md file where you will find the necessary instructions for the two challenges

When you finish, remember to:

1. Give read access to TumeloTechTask account to the private repository (Settings > Access > Collaborators)
2. Let us know by email that you have finished the test and send us the URL of the repository
